			    LiRE Version 0.11
			    =================


What are the requirements?
--------------------------

 Runtime environment:
 x86 platform  (Pentium I or better) 

 Development:
 linux system with GCC 3.2 (or better)


How to install it?
------------------

 1. cd to a preferred directory (e.g. /usr/src)
 2. tar xvjf <PATH-TO-LiRE-ARCHIVE>/LiRE-X.X.tar.bz2
 3. cd LiRE
 4. make menuconfig
 5. make build
 6. make install
    This will create the directory <LiRE-OUTPUT_DIR> with a bootable LiRE-Distribution,
    containing all selected packages or if selected a netboot image.


What are all these directories for?
-----------------------------------
 <LiRE_DIR>/
              base       -> Contains all LiRE specific files and devices e.g. /etc,/dev,...
              configs    -> LiRE creates for each package a configuration file which is located 
here
	      kconfig    -> kconfig files
	      libs       -> Contains all non-package specific libraries e.g. libc
              packages   -> All packages as binaries.
              scripts    -> LiRE scripts for configuration compilation and installation
              src        -> Build configuration,depend file and scripts for each package

How to build packages?
----------------------

 For each LiRE-package exists a directory in <LiRE-DIR>/src (e.g. <LiRE-DIR>/src/linux/).
 If you want to build your own kernel for example, you have to download the kernel sources 
 and link them to <LiRE-DIR>/src/linux/~linux. If you have an own configfile for the kernel You
 can copy it to <LiRE-DIR>/src/linux/configs. 
 Now you can start "make menuconfig" and select the kernel to be build. 
 You have to enter make build to start the build process.
 It's the same procedure for the other packages.
 
 If you select a package for build and don't have linked the sources it will try to get the sources
 from the "LiRE update directory" (menu->packages). You can force this running "make update".
 Using this feature you have to provide a directory/ftp-tree with the following structure.

 directory structure:
 --------------------

 <UPDATE-DIR>
  /binaries
    /<PACKAGENAME>
      ./<PACKAGENAME>.tar.bz2
      ./version
  /sources
    /<PACKAGENAME>
      ./<PACKAGENAME>_stable.tar.bz2
      ./<PACKAGENAME>_unstable.tar.bz2
      ./version_stable
      ./version_unstable
 
 e.g.

 /srv/ftp
  /binaries
    /xenomai
      ./xenomai.tar.bz2
      ./version
  /sources
    /xenomai
      ./xenomai_stable.tar.bz2
      ./xenomai_unstable.tar.bz2
      ./version_stable
      ./version_unstable

 In the "binaries" directory you can copy prebuilt tars, like the ones coming with LiRE.
 The "sources" directory should be provided with vanilla-source of the packages.
 The "version*" files only contain the version number. There is an exception for the linux sources, the "sources"
 directory of this package has to look like the binary one, to say without any _stable or _unstable tag.
 We are using this system to provide up to date packages for our users.
 A more in-depth documentation of this feature has to follow.
